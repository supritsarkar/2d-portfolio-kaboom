  pc: `This is my PC setup — where I bring code to life.
I mostly work in JavaScript and TypeScript, building web apps and games.
From debugging to deploying, this desk has seen it all.`,

  "bca-degree": `This is my BCA degree — a journey through theory, UNIX, DBMS, and a lot of practicals.
It gave me the base, but real growth came through building and breaking things on my own.`,

  desk: `This desk is where my projects take shape. From planning full-stack MERN apps to designing gameplay logic in Kaboom.js,
it’s the battlefield where every bug gets squashed and every idea comes alive.`,

  tv: `My screen for breaks. But let's be honest — I usually end up watching JavaScript tutorials,
Next.js breakdowns, or someone building a game with pure JS. Productivity, but make it passive.`,

  bed: `This is where rest happens — and ideas strike.
I often lie down and end up mentally designing components or thinking through DSA problems.
Sleep comes second when logic is looping in your head.`,

  resume: `This is my desk and on it is my resume.Gonna upoload soon !`,

//   projects: `This entire portfolio is built with Kaboom.js and Tiled map editor.
// The player, map, and hitboxes are dynamically rendered. Movement and dialogue systems are handwritten.
// Everything you see is powered by raw JavaScript and passion.`,

  library: `My digital bookshelf isn't about books — it's about skills.
Right now it's stacked with Next.js, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Java for DSA practice.
I believe building projects is the best way to learn.`,

But you’ll miss the rest of the story — I’m just getting started.`,

  "sofa-table": `That's my sofa. I like to relax here and watch YouTube.`,
